    <h2>Hi Eekshitha,</h2>
    <p>I don’t know exactly when this started.</p>
    <p>Somewhere between growing up… and growing apart…</p>
    <p>You became someone I never really stopped thinking about.</p>
    <p>This isn’t a big dramatic confession.</p>
    <p>It’s just something honest.</p>
    <p>I like you. I always have, in my own quiet way.</p>
    <p>And I just didn’t want to leave it unsaid anymore.</p>
